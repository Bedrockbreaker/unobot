# Card Bot
Modular Discord Card Game Bot

See [the wiki](https://github.com/Bedrockbreaker/unobot/wiki) for how to use

## Road Map

### v3.1.0
* Reimplementation of Uno house rules

### v3.2.0
* Update to [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) v12.2.0 (latest as of 4/20/20)
* Update to [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14.0.0 (latest as of 4/25/20)
* Move hosting site to [glitch.com](glitch.com)

### v3.3.0
* Overhaul of display system
* Instead of displaying a single card, will use [node-canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) to render a scene with a basic table background, user avatars, scores, etc.
* May include changing how individual players' hands are displayed in DMs

### v3.4.0
* Local storage for server-mods, enabling discord admins to create their own card game mods.

### v3.5.0
* Exploding kittens + expansions

### v3.6.0
* Phase 10

### v3.7.0
* Three Dragon Ante

### v3.8.0
* Uno variations (uno flip, etc.)

### v3.9.0
* Monopoly (test for code stability and expandability)

### v3.10.0
* More board games/card games
* Risk?
